# Simple Python exercises

:bulb: I've decided to learn the basics of Python in order to get a general understanding of the structure and use of programming languages. While learning, I wrote some simple mini-programs. I'm planning to gradually skill up in the near future.

:receipt: The first batch of my mini-programs involves e.g.:
* entering password with three attempts,
* checking if a figure is square or rectangle,
* calculating rectangle area,
* calculating factorial,
* calculating BMI,
* drawing a Xmas tree,
* playing with strings (e.g. checking length, eliminating vowels),
* encrytping a text using Caesar's cipher,
* counting down seconds (timer),
* sorting user's numbers and finding the highest,
* guessing the number (a few versions),
* tossing a coin,
* calculating a Fibonacci sequence element,
* playing with randomly generated numbers,
* verifying validity of a PESEL number (Polish personal id).
